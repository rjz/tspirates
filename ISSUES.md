There's much to improve around here! Some ideas to get you started:

- Clean up collision detection API
- Separate "world-time" from clock frequency (i.e., use variable `dt`)
- Different types of ships, or "ship health" (multiple shots needed to sink)
- Use a real physics engine (or expand our model to allow for mass, force, and
  momentum)
- Show animations when something's hit (explosions? Sinking ships?)
- Animate water (tide, ship wakes, projectile splashes, etc.)
- Replace HTML/CSS rendering with another rendering engine
- Clean up message console typography, UI
